The proposal includes:\nA five-storey apartment building where all dwelling units are secured as rental; and\nA floor space ratio (FSR) up to 2.4.\nThe application is being considered under the Secured Rental Policy\n(External link)\n(Section 2.4 Rezonings in Low-Density Transition Areas).\nIf approved, this site's zoning will change to RR-2B. Any development on the site would have to conform to these zoning regulations and design guidelines. This approach differs from a site-specific Comprehensive Development (CD) District rezoning. It allows for a simplified rezoning process and provides greater clarity and consistency on the types of new secured rental buildings that may be built in eligible low-density areas.\nThe specific form of development (building design) will be reviewed through a future Development Permit process. Application drawings will be available for viewing and comment at that time.\nRezoning Policy Background\nOn December 14, 2021, Council approved amendments to the Secured Rental Policy (SRP) to allow simplified rezonings in low-density areas near shopping, public transportation and other amenities. This policy is intended to help:\nIncrease housing choice for renter households\nStreamline processes and clarifying policy requirements\nDiversify rental housing options\nRespond to the City’s Climate Emergency\nHelp enhance local shopping areas\nImproving livability of rental housing\nLearn more about:\nSecured Rental Policy\n(External link)\nPublic feedback during the development of SRP\n(External link)\nHow SRP helps deliver key objectives of the Housing Vancouver Strategy\n(External link)\nSites eligible for rezoning in low-density transition areas (map included)\n(External link)",

This process included a reconfiguration of the school site, which presented an opportunity to repurpose the southern portion of the property for rental housing. With Ministry approval, the Vancouver School Board finalized a 99-year lease with Vittori Developments Ltd. for the southern portion of our school site as per Board Policy 20 - Disposal of land or improvements.
